# **GULP and NPM reusable code**
## ** Description:**
-- Using Gulp with NPM for Node js apps is a great way to create tasks. 
-- In this case, I bundled all of my js files under the dist folder as well as all of my css styles.
-- This saved me time from having to go back to the index.html file to add either script tags or stylesheet links.

1. Open Terminal/Git Bash.
2. Type “cd oca/startnow-ops100-gulp-and-npm”.
3. Type “node server/index.js”
4. Open an Internet Browser Window
5. Type “localhost:8080”
6. Click the “More cats right meow!!” button.
7. Repeat step 6 as many times as you want. (There are about 20 different cats to choose from)
8. Why so many coders like cat programs baffles me. I'm a dog guy. I have a Schnauzer named Otto. 
9. Otto is not a fan of cats.
